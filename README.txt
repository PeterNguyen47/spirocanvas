SPIROCANVAS

Spirocanvas is a HTML5 application to draw spirographs and to share them to social networking websites like flickr, facebook and twitter. Most of the coding is done in HTML / Javascript / JQuery, with minimal PHP coding.


Installation:

	2. Checkout the source from http://spirocanvas.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
	3. Copy the source to the root directory of your local server.

Running:
	1. Open any web server.
	2. Navigate to localhost/index.html (if you copied the source files directly to root)
